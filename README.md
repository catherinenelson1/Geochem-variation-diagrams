# Geochem-variation-diagrams
##Creates publication quality geochemical variation diagrams in Python.

This is a little piece of code to create the classic Harker geochemical variation plots in Python, using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).

Variation diagrams are plots of the most common oxides found in rocks. They can be used to tell whether one group of rocks is related to another, or display trendlines that indicate different processes of formation.
